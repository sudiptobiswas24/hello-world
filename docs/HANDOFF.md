# Handoff — start here

This is an ERP for a woven polypropylene sack plant in India: Django 5.2,
DRF, React, Odoo-like. The owner wants every module as deep as Odoo's,
and correct before wide. This file says where things stand and what comes
next. It was written at the end of a long session on 8 October 2026, so
that a new session can start small.

## 0. Read, then verify, before doing anything

First, look for interrupted work and resume it from where it stopped (CLAUDE.md, "Interrupted work"). At the last handoff (after g17) nothing was interrupted: no agent, background job or gate was running, and every worktree's commits were pushed.

1. Read, in order:
   - `CLAUDE.md`: house rules and the mistakes this project keeps making.
   - this file.
   - `scripts/gate/README.md`: how a release is gated.
   - `docs/handoff/findings.md`: the last audit and what each fix branch holds.
   - `docs/RISKS.md`, "Open defects": every defect seen and not yet fixed, numbered.
   - `.claude/skills/audit/SKILL.md`: before any audit.
2. Verify every branch below exists, with `git ls-remote origin 'refs/heads/claude/erp-*'`.
   If any is missing, stop and tell the owner.

| Branch | What it is |
|---|---|
| `claude/erp-creation-guidance-ox5afo` | **The product.** Gated and pushed through b1d03ed (g17), plus documentation commits. PR #4 (the owner's, into master) tracks it. Push only here, and only after a gate. |
| `claude/erp-fix-{store,pay,asset,make,race,ui}` | The six fix branches. All are in g17 (b1d03ed); kept for their history. Safe to delete. |
| `claude/erp-leftover-{ctree,htree,ltree}` | Edits left by sessions before 8 October. Checked on 8 October: all superseded by the product (ctree was an early draft of 9d81846). Safe to delete. |
| `claude/erp-g17-wip`, `claude/erp-g17-make-wip` | Backups of g17 before it was pushed. Safe to delete. |
| `claude/erp-gate-scratch`, `claude/erp-gate-results` | Scratch, from running two gate lanes in another cloud session. Safe to delete. |


## 1. Environment, once per new container

```
cd <repo>
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt   # if .venv is missing
(cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build)                               # the browser tests open this build
pg_isready -q || service postgresql start                              # role erp/erp, as the gate uses it
```

- Chromium for Playwright is at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`. Pass
  `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`, or the
  browser tests skip and the count looks right.
- Quick test runs: `PYTHONPATH=scripts/gate .venv/bin/python manage.py test <labels> --settings=fastsettings --exclude-tag migration`.
- A background job may run two hours at most, so gate lanes run separately
  (scripts/gate/README.md).
- Odoo 19 Community source, read-only, for comparison work:
  `git clone --depth 1 --branch 19.0 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git`,
  then `git sparse-checkout set addons/<module> ...`.

## 2. Next steps, in order

g17 is pushed (b1d03ed). It holds:
- the six fix branches, with the duplicated rules merged;
- the review of those fixes, and fixes for what the review found (two release blockers among them);
- the open-defects register.

findings.md says what each fix branch held. docs/RISKS.md, "Open
defects", is the one list of what is still open.

1. **The owner chooses what comes next.** Two candidates were put to the
   owner on 8 October:
   - **Pilot path:** import the plant's real files (docs/IMPORT.md), then
     the pilot in docs/PILOT.md. Before anything is filed with the
     government, run a probe audit of GST and accounting, which have not
     had one.
   - **Another audit round:** sales, purchasing, accounting, GST, quality
     and CRM have not had a probe audit like the 8 October one;
     permissions and performance have never been audited.

   If the owner has not answered, ask before starting either.
2. **Decisions owed by the owner and the plant's accountant.** Put them
   as one list; do not decide them:
   - posting a pay run ahead of its pay date, which is allowed and is
     voided on its own day (core `correction_date`);
   - freight on goods already gone going to cost of sales rather than
     to production cost (O42 is related);
   - a leaver's overpayment recovered as a receivable from the former
     employee: are there legal limits on recovering wages? (O28);
   - partial returns taking the earliest route step first (O30);
   - disposal reversing a closed month's charge (O9);
   - dated corrections stamping stock when entered (O43).
3. **Open defects** in docs/RISKS.md, by kind: books first, then race,
   then rule. O42 (a landed-cost release does not follow goods moved
   since) is next. Each fix needs a test that fails without it, and its
   commit names the id.
4. **Review every fix before its gate**, by someone other than its
   author, with probes that try to break it. In the g17 round, fixes
   that each had a test failing without them still held two release
   blockers.
5. **A gate takes fixes for what is broken, nothing else.** Refactors,
   migrations for data that does not exist, and widened checks go to
   the register.

## 3. The owner's standing instructions

- Go deeper, not wider. Look for matured bugs, not only decimal places.
  Fix issues so they do not recur: patterns, shared rules, audit checks,
  and CLAUDE.md lessons.
- Decide; do not ask, unless a choice is truly theirs and blocking. Say
  in a line what was decided.
- Run work in parallel with subagents, at most three or four at once.
  Keep the Opus model. Write narrow briefs: grep and line ranges, never
  whole large files, capped reports. Tokens are a concern; avoid many
  small turns.
- More compute means more cloud sessions, each with its own machine.
  Check a remote lane's skip count before trusting it.
- No pull requests unless asked. PR #4 is the owner's; watch it, do not
  rewrite it.
- Commit as `git -c user.name=Claude -c user.email=noreply@anthropic.com`.
  No model names in code or commit messages beyond the trailer. Every
  commit ends with the Gate line, then the trailers
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` and
  `Claude-Session: <the session URL>`.
- Push only to `claude/erp-creation-guidance-ox5afo`, after a gate.
  Scratch branches `claude/erp-*` are allowed for backups and other
  sessions.
- Be direct; lead with what is wrong. No praise without reasons.

## 4. Decisions already made (do not reopen)

- **Money moves only through accounts marked "bank, cash or card"**
  (`Account.holds_money`). Receivables, payables, tax accounts and
  company settings refuse a marked account. The mark is fixed once an
  account is posted to. The account form on screen sets it.
- **Piece-rate overpayment is recovered from the next run.** A leaver's
  is recovered in the final run. A shortfall becomes a receivable (to
  build).
- **Agents and gates.** Fix agents work on their own branches. One
  integrator reviews and gates. A gate runs on the newest commit and
  covers everything pushed with it.

## 5. Loose ends

- PR #4 (the owner's, into master) tracks the product branch. Check its
  state after each push; do not rewrite it.
- Cloud session session_01JhBJNMa8eEqsnUwAeQ5Zhy ran two g16 lanes. It
  can be archived.
